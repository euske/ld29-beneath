
DEBUG FEATURE: M to hide/show the masks, N to skip the level.


#1. BUG: Title screen logo fucks up after you die (screenshot in the images folder)

#2. Minor BUG: Title music doesn't pause when the game is paused. (Maybe turn off the pause
screen completely when on the title screen?)

#0. Enemy 3 = Enemy 2 flying left to right instead of up and down

#20. Title Screen!: Game Logo, "Press [button] to Start", tell the controls,
tell the objective, Credits on the bottom, play title music.
 euske: 1 hour work.  (Level select menu is preferrable)

#21. Game Over Screen: "Game Over" or "You Win!", "Final score: ###",
something like "You collected all the parts you need to become human!" or
whatever his goal is and a failed version, "Press [button] to Play Again", 
player's cheer animation (if you win)
 euske: 30 min of work.

#106. Play an easter egg sound effect (once per level) when the player touches tile 106
 (EASTER_EGG in Tile.as)

#24. Level transition effect. (Fade to black, horizontal wipe, whatever)
 euske: 30 min of work.
(No longer needed during LD now that the cheer animation plays)

----------------------- DONE STUFF or not doing for now

#??. (DONE) Unbreakable.wav doesn't play when digging sideways.

#6. (DONE) Jump higher the longer spacebar is held. (This should help fix #5)
 euske: 30 min work. maybe.

#?. (DONE) Make Status bar dark

#Number. (DONE) That thing where lava draws a little bit around the tile? Deep lava needs
to do that one or two pixels up. (SUPER LOW PRIORITY)

#17. (HALF-DONE) We need to track and display how many corpses you've collected from graves.
 "[icon] [# collected] / [# total]"
 euske: 30 mins of work for adding symbols. (just text for now)

#18. (HALF-DONE) Replace "Health: 3" with "Health: ? ? ?"  (? = heart icon)
 hearts.png has 4 frames and two animations:
  - 0 and 1 alternating (like lava)
  - When you get hit, go to 2, then 3, then stop animating.
  - When you heal (food pickup), go back to 0 and resume the first animation.
 euske: 1 hour work. 
 euske: heart blinking is too much work for now. *heartbleed*

#8. (HALF-DONE) Food pickups that restore 1 health. Should work like collectibles,
but instead of increasing score they heal. (Tile 80, random graphics
like gravestones will be added later)
 euske: cannot begin until the map/tiles are ready.
 euske: Robocake is now a food.

#3. (HALF_DONE) Enemy AI needs to check if the tile it wants to move to AND the
one below where it wants to move are both EMPTY, then turn around.
Also if the tile it is standing on is dug, it needs to fall.
Maybe we can take the current AI, make it move vertically, and it can
be a bat enemy or something.
 euske: Abandoned the third enemy, replaced with robocake.
  (Still don't know what to do with it...)

#10. (DONE) Level win condition. (Loot ~75% of gravestones in level so people
don't spend hours trying to find the last few, especially if they become 
unreachable from reckless digging)

#4 (FIXED). Digging is as fast as walking and shouldn't be.
 (Digging down is still as fast!)
 euske: Digging mechanics renovated. Lots of parameters added to tweak to make it feel "right"

#11. (ALMOST DONE) Sound effect for trying to dig an undiggable tile.
 (Sound effect exists, just needs to play) (Doesn't play when digging sideways!)
 euske: another mechanics tweak needed, 1 hour work.

#5. (FIXED) Minor physics issue (not a bug): Can't move into 1 tile gaps while
falling. [ images_for_sharing_with_the_internet/physics_issue.png ]
Reducing the top of the player's hitbox by 1 pixel might work?
 euske: the player hitbox is now 12x12 (center bottom)

#9. (DONE) Gravestones should act like treasure chests. When opened, change
the tile to 74 (destroyed grave) and play both dig and collect sounds.
 (Dirt below graves will be undiggable, so don't worry about what
  happens if you dig under one)
 euske: 30 mins of work.

#7. (DONE) The money bag tile (79) is for collectibles and should work the
way gravestones did before they acted like treasure chests.
 euske: cannot test until the map is ready.

#19. (DONE) Track score and timer, then display them on the HUD.
 euske: only text.

#1 (FIXED).  BUG: You can dig sideways while on ladders without holding the
dig button! 

#2. (FIXED)  Boulders/Rocks need to be drawn on top of dirt if
the tile is undiggable so the player has visual feedback. Whether they
show up all the time or only when you try to dig the tile is up to
what's easier for you.

#12 (FIXED). There is no normal walk cycle. It's just doing the digging
animation for walking.  We just need Crystal Hawk to make an animation
for that, and a jumping animation too. (You look like you're digging
while jumping, looks silly)

#13 (FIXED). When you take damage, and when invicibility frames end you're
still in the damage pose instead of going back to an idle standing frame.

#14. (FIXED) Minor graphic bug: If you move left while digging and stop moving, (but
the dig button is still held unless you let go of it at the same time)
you flip to the right instead of continuing to face left.

#15. (FIXED) Minor graphic bug: When player presses ladder climbing buttons and there's 
no ladder the ladder climbing animation still plays instead of the idle frame.

#16. (DONE) Randomly flip and rotate rocks & collectables
 euske: flipped images need to be in tileset.png

#22. (DONE) Decorative tiles (green crouch easter egg) should have no collision.
(They'll be listed at the top of Tiles.as)

#25. Pause button (Esc). To reset the game, press R while paused. We should
change the pause screen so it says paused instead of a white arrow and add
"Press R to Restart" or something like that.
 euske: currently de-focusing window should make the game pause. This is a browser game so automatic pause is preferred. ESC behavior should be probablly kept this way (as the game might be randomly glitched/freezed).

#23. Rain background. Animates like lava, but is placed differently. Only one
tile will be placed in tilemap.csv (tile 107), and its placement sets the row where
rain ends and dirt background begins. (All rows above and current row draw rain, one
row below becomes tile 111, all other rows are tile 1). If more than one rain
tile is in a map, use the topmost one and ignore the rest. (I'll be careful though)

#26. Change tiles around where the player digs.  (AFTER LD)
