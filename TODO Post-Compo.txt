TODO rules: assign a unique ID to every item and NEVER change it once assigned, so that we can track them without confusing ourselves. IDs don't have to be ordered.

	Title Screen Tweaks:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

#1. Minor BUG: Title music doesn't pause when the game is paused. (Maybe turn off the pause
screen completely when on the title screen?)

#2. Diagonally scrolling background effect

#3. Replace Level 1/2/3 select with Level Select/Instructions/Options/Credits

#4. Use the cheer animation to illustrate which menu option is selected

#5. Add a graphic on the right side to fill the space. (When there is one)

#6. Version number in bottom corner (e.g. Post-Compo v0.02 or something)

#25. the necrobot guy should be popped into the screen like Zing!


	Levels:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#7. More levels! Probably gonna add at least two, but probably three.

#8. Move lava, graves, collectibles, etc. to separate tilesets. Makes it easier to add stuff
without having to move all of the tiles over.

#9. Spawn enemies on map load, not just when the player sees the spawner.

#10. Spike spawner that chooses rendered tile and collisions based on nearby tiles.

#11. Graphics BUG: Lava rendering improperly on tiles next to it in certain circumstances.
(Might need to draw multiple rects on tiles next to lava instead of just one)

#12. Play a random voice sound clip once per level when the player touches a trigger.
(Tile 106 in the compo version)

#13. Level Transition effect. (Fade to black? Horizontal wipe? Something else?)

#14. Fog of War improvements: Larger uncovering radius in open caves; Tiles at the edge of the
uncovering radius have partial opacity instead of full transparency.

#15. Rain Effect. (All rows of tiles above and including where an invisible tile render just like
how lava does, but with rain tiles)

#16. Water & Water Physics. (Just for the player, no need to go overboard with fluid simulation)
(Probably should save this for if we remake it after post-compo)


	Other:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#17. Icon for graves looted instead of just saying "Graves"

#18. Should robot-cake even move like enemies? I guess we could just set their speed to 0 and see
how it looks.

#19. Collectibles floating animation (bob up and down 1 or 2 pixels)

#20. Minor BUG: Level complete cheer animation can be invisible if you finish a level while
in invincibility frames.

#21. Loop title and win screen music. (Fond3ll would have to separate out the voice clips first)

#22. Randomize graves/rocks/collectibles on runtime instead of compiling.

#23. Win/Lose screen art. (Like the title screen one, if CrystalHawk wants to make 'em)

#24. Fix the slight lag when jumping. (Don't wait a long press, alter the velocity in-air instead)
