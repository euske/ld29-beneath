TODO rules: assign a unique ID to every item and NEVER change it once assigned, so that we can track them without confusing ourselves. IDs don't have to be ordered.

	Title Screen Tweaks:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

#3. Replace Level 1/2/3 select with Level Select/Instructions/Options/Credits

#3.5 Add level select, instructions, and credits screens. (Maybe not options if we can't think of
any options we would need)

#4. Use the cheer animation to illustrate which menu option is selected

#5. Add a graphic on the right side to fill the space. (When there is one)

#6. Version number in bottom corner (e.g. Post-Compo v0.02 or something)

#25.5 (See #25) Maybe "zing" him in sooner and add a white flash to class it all up? Also we should
see how it looks with the skelebot_drawn_small version. (Polish; Low Priority)

	Levels:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#8. Move lava, graves, collectibles, etc. to separate tilesets. Makes it easier to add stuff
without having to move all of the tiles over. [Files are separated, just need code to match]

#9. Spawn enemies on map load, not just when the player sees the spawner.

#14. Fog of War improvements: Larger uncovering radius in open caves; Tiles at the edge of the
uncovering radius have partial opacity instead of full transparency.

#10. Spike spawner that chooses rendered tile and collisions based on nearby tiles.

#15. Rain Effect. (All rows of tiles above and including where an invisible tile render just like
how lava does, but with rain tiles)

#12. Play a random voice sound clip once per level when the player touches a trigger.
(Tile 106 in the compo version)

#13. Level Transition effect. (Fade to black? Horizontal wipe? Something else?)

#11. Graphics BUG: Lava rendering improperly on tiles next to it in certain circumstances.
(Might need to draw multiple rects on tiles next to lava instead of just one)

#16. Water & Water Physics. (Just for the player, no need to go overboard with fluid simulation)
(Renders like lava, but maybe make slightly translucent? Will edit liquid.png if necessary)
(Probably should save this for if we remake it after post-compo)


	Other:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#24. Fix the slight lag when jumping. (Don't wait a long press, alter the velocity in-air instead)

#27. BUG: Digging under an enemy when they're on a single tile gets them stuck in midair! Should
either give them gravity or kill them.

#20. Minor BUG: Level complete cheer animation can be invisible if you finish a level while
in invincibility frames.

#7. Implement heart animation (pulled from old TODO)
 symbols.png has 4 frames and two animations for the hearts:
  - 0 and 1 alternating (like lava) (only for the rightmost filled heart; the rest just sit on 1)
  - When you get hit, go to 2, then 3, then stop animating.
  - When you heal (food pickup), go back to 0 and resume the first animation.

#19. Collectibles floating animation (bob up and down 1 or 2 pixels)

#21. Loop title and win screen music. (Fond3ll would have to separate out the voice clips first)

#22. Randomize graves/rocks/collectibles on runtime instead of compiling.

#17. Icon for graves looted instead of just saying "Graves"

#18. Should robot-cake even move like enemies? I guess we could just set their speed to 0 and see
how it looks.

#26. Sound effects for: splashing in water & lava + landing on dirt and platforms + climbing ladders

#23. Win/Lose screen art. (Like the title screen one, if CrystalHawk wants to make 'em)


	COMPLETED:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#1. Minor BUG: Title music doesn't pause when the game is paused. (Maybe turn off the pause
screen completely when on the title screen?)

#2. Diagonally scrolling background effect

#25. the necrobot guy should be popped into the screen like Zing!
